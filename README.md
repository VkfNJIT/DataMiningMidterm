   + `git clone https://github.com/VkfNJIT/DataMiningMidterm.git` 

3. Change directory to the path of the cloned repository using `cd` `path/to/project` on the command line

4. List all the files and folders in the your path using the `ls` command.

5. Then you want make sure you have the dependencies installed in order to run the algorithm successfully, so enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Once that has been successfully completed, on your terminal type:

   `python MidtermAlgorithm.py` 

7. You should have a prompt appear that ask for you enter the number of the itemset that you want the algorithm to run. 

   + It must be an int value from 1 to 5, 
   + It will then ask for you to enter a minimum support value from (1, 100)
   + It will ask for you to enter a minimum confidence value from (1, 100)
